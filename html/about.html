                <li>I actually came up with the idea for this website last year during a mentoring</li>
                <li>session. There was a volunteer who introduced himself and said that he</li>
                <li>made procedural art for fun. The idea interested me, and I googled it later.</li>
                <li>After the competition was over, I did some research and decided I would make it</li>
                <li>my project for this year. I did some research, found some code, a few guides,</li>
                <li>and a few websites. Then, I put this website together for the competition.</li>
                <li>I decided I wanted to do something interesting for the website, and after</li>
                <li>asking for a bit of advice, I decided to make a website entirely about</li>
                <li>Skeuomorphism. Thats when elements of your website look like objects in real</li>
                <li>life that have the same function. So I made my website look like a bedroom.</li>
                <li>A bedroom thats a lot cleaner than my bedroom.</li>
